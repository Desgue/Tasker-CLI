# Tasker CLI

A project and taks management tool in your CLI

The Cli is normally the home for many developers and having to change to a browser or other apps may cause distraction and lost of focus, 
Tasker is a simple Cli TUI designed to help you keep track of your current projects and its associated task without the overhead of managing other apps.
With keybindings inspired in Vim it has an intuitive feel and because of BubbleTea, a beautiful look.
If you always get side tracked in your personal projects, Tasker is a good additional tool for your toolkit.

## Background
Tasker actully is a proof of concept developed over the course of a weekend inspired in the BubbleTea guide on how to make Tui apps. 
Its conception began when I was looking for side projects to work on and develop new skills. 
I found that I get lost too easly and decided to build something to keep me accounted whenever I decide to start a new project. 
After finding about BubbleTea and the wonder of convenience of terminal applications I decided to start my learning with Tasker Cli.
