# Tasker CLI

A project and taks management tool in your CLI

Many developers thrive in the focused environment of the command line. Switching to browsers or other apps can disrupt their workflow and lead to distractions.
Tasker is a simple CLI TUI (terminal user interface) application designed specifically for developers. It helps you stay focused on your current projects and their associated tasks by eliminating the distractions and overhead of managing separate apps.
Inspired by Vim keybindings, Tasker offers an intuitive user experience. Additionally, BubbleTea allows it to maintain a visually appealing interface.
If you find yourself getting sidetracked while working on personal projects, Tasker can be a valuable addition to your development toolkit.

## Background
Tasker is actually a proof of concept developed over a weekend, inspired by the BubbleTea guide on creating TUI apps.
It originated when I was looking for side projects to work on and develop new skills. I realized that I easily get distracted, so I decided to build something that would hold me accountable whenever I start a new project.
After learning about BubbleTea and the convenience of terminal applications, I decided to start my learning journey with Tasker CLI.
